💫 **Project Overview/Goals:**

Thesis Quest is a top-down college simulator game with an RPG and puzzle elements.
Set on a university campus, players guide the main character through various challenges to complete their PhD thesis before the deadline. 
The game highlights the balance of time, stress, and mental wellbeing, offering a fun yet relatable simulation of student life.
Our goal is to deliver entertaining and relatable experiences through diverse mini-games and challenges, offering broad appeal, replayability, and promoting a message of self-care.
